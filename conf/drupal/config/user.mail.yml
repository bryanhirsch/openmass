  body: "Welcome to your authoring account for the Mass.gov content management system (CMS). Below, you’ll learn how to log in to edit.mass.gov so that you can start creating content.\r\n\r\nSETTING UP YOUR ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nThis email tries to help you set up your account as quickly as possible. If you’d like a more detailed description of what to do and what everything means, try this set of instructions: https://www.mass.gov/support/account-setup\r\n\r\nThe first thing to know is that you can only log in and use the CMS from an approved IP address. This usually means you must be using your work computer or be connected to it through a virtual private network (VPN).\r\n\r\nTo log in to edit.mass.gov to create content, you’ll need to set up 2 things:\r\n\r\n1. Your user account and password.\r\n2. Two-factor authentication (TFA). TFA helps us keep the site secure.\r\n\r\nTo set up your user account click this login link, which you’ll only be able to use once: [user:one-time-login-url].\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you get an “unauthorized” message, go to https://edit.mass.gov/user/password. Click “submit.” You’ll receive a new link.\r\n\r\nTo set up 2-factor authentication, use this YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE045X5DoCs&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nNOTE: Using a smartphone application for 2-factor authentication will make your life much easier in the long run. You do not need a state-issued phone to do this.: You can use your own personal phone (using the same 2-factor apps you'd use for your personal email or other account).\r\n\r\nOnce you've set everything up, you'll be able to log in at https://edit.mass.gov/user. You may want to bookmark this URL.\r\n\r\nCREATING AND PUBLISHING CONTENT \r\n\r\nNow that you’ve logged into the CMS, you should probably get comfortable with how authors create content on Mass.gov. We’ve created a training kit for new authors to get you oriented: https://www.mass.gov/support/training-kit\r\n\r\nYou can also browse our resources at https://massgovdigital.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/. We have a number of helpful articles and training videos that will help you understand how to get the most out of the CMS.\r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage you to sign up for our newsletter to stay up to date on changes to the CMS: https://www.mass.gov/support/newsletter-signup\r\n\r\nFinally, if you need help using the CMS, or planning and authoring content, you can sign up for a Content Strategy session with the Digital Services Content team. They’ll meet with you 1-on-1 to help you work through your content-related problems: https://www.mass.gov/support/office-hours\r\n \r\nIf you have any comments or questions, please go to https://massgov.service-now.com to request Mass.gov support. You can find instructions on how to do this here: https://www.mass.gov/support/how-to-request-support.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know your ServiceNow account information, you can call CommonHelp at 844-435-7629. They can give you your account information or request Mass.gov support on your behalf."
